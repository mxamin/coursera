The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world.  Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical, and social sciences.  By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples of calculus appearing in daily life.\n This course is a first and friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems.","isReal":true,"launchedAt":1402599600000,"isVerificationEnabled":false,"promoPhoto":"https://coursera-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/flex/calculus1.png","primaryLanguageCodes":["en"],"subtitleLanguageCodes":[],"isSubtitleTranslationEnabled":true,"estimatedWorkload":"25 hours of videos and quizzes","instructorIds":[1667833],"partnerIds":[28],"previewUserIds":[],"isRestrictedMembership":false,"categoryIds":[5],"overridePartnerLogos":{},"s3Prefix":"HRSOu-BiEeOZpyIACyeXpA","courseMaterial":{"elements":[{"id":"71NEM","name":"Welcome to Calculus One","description":"Welcome to Calculus!
